## Overview

**Dext** is a JavaScript powered smart launcher. Built with JavaScript behind the influences of Alfred.

Made compatible with Alfred workflows that is powered by node (see: [alfy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy)).

***Note: Currently available only for Mac OS X platform. Please help contribute for Windows and Linux users.***

## Install

$ npm install dext
```

## Installing Plugins and Themes

Dext Package Manager is included out of the box to allow for managing configurations easily. (This package may be extracted in the future to keep the app file size low)

### Activating the CLI

```bash
# link the module globally to create a symlink to the bin file
$ npm link
```

### CLI Usage

# installs a new plugin/theme
$ dpm install dext-my-plugin

# uninstalls an existing plugin/theme
